# 🚀 K-Means Clustering on Mall Customers Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm to segment customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score** using the **Mall Customers dataset**.  
It helps in understanding customer behavior, which is valuable for targeted marketing strategies.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python
- 📊 Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- 📈 Matplotlib for visualization
- ⚙️ scikit-learn for clustering

## 📂 Dataset
- `Mall_Customers.csv`
- Columns used: 
  - `Annual Income (k$)`
  - `Spending Score (1-100)`

## 🔍 What this project does
- Loads the dataset and performs basic checks for missing data.
- Extracts **Annual Income** and **Spending Score** for clustering.
- Uses **Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of clusters.
- Applies **K-Means Clustering** with `k=5`.
- Visualizes the clusters with distinct colors, markers, and centroids.

## 📊 Results
- Found 5 optimal clusters using the Elbow Method.
- Visualized customer segments to help understand spending patterns vs income.

## 🚀 How to run
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kmeans-mall-customers.git
    cd kmeans-mall-customers
    ```

2. Install dependencies (ideally in a virtual environment):
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```

3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python kmeans_clustering.py
    ```

(Or execute step by step in a Jupyter/Colab notebook.)

## ✏️ Code Highlights
```python
for i in range(1,11):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=i, init='k-means++', random_state=1)
    kmeans.fit(x)
    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)
🚀 Future Improvements
Try DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering.

Use more features (e.g., Age, Gender).

Deploy as a simple web app to upload customer data and see segments.
```
